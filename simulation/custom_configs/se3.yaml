constraints:

  tilt_angle_saturation: 0.0 # [deg], disabled when 0.0

  attitude_rate_saturation: 100.0 # [rad/s]

  # When the controller wants to output tilt larger than this,
  # it will return an empty command instead, which should trigger
  # a failsafe in the control manager.
  tilt_angle_failsafe: 0.0 # [deg], disabled when 0.0
